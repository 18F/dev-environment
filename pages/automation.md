Automation brings several key advantages to your development environment and you should use it wherever possible.
Some of these benefits are: 

* It increases speed and reduces the likelyhood of an error.
* Automated processes can be tested, just like the code that's written by developers.
* It can be version controlled. Each change is recorded in the version control along with comments as to why that change needed to happen; with manual steps there's no such history.
* It lets testers and developers spend more time on adding or fixing functionality instead of monotonous tasks.
* Something that is automated can be verified and thus can be trusted.

####Tasks that are great for automation:

* Build of the system under design
* Deployment of the system under design
* Execution and report generation of:
    * Unit tests
    * Code coverage
    * Functional testing
    * Load testing
    * Code quality metrics and conventions
* Health check of systems
