Developers can create and delete systems on demand, with group alloction and quotas as needed to avoid overcommiting resources. 
These self-provisioned systems are identical with documented exceptions for network configuration, authentication, etc. 
All services should be developed using SSL for proper testing. 
This requires a self-service system to issue certificates, so applications can be developed and tested using the same configuration used in production.
