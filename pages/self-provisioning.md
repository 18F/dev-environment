Developers can create and delete systems on-demand, with group alloction and quotas as needed to avoid over-commiting resources. 
These self-provisioned systems are identical with documented exceptions for network configuration, autherntication, etc. 
All services should be developed using SSL for proper testing. 
This requires a self-service system to issue certificates, so that applications can be developed and tested using the same configuration used in production.
