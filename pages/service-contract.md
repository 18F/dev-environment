<a name="service-contract"></a>
There is a defined support contract specifying a base-line level of service and software support.
This should include but isn't limited to:

* System configuration is managed in a version control system and should be automatically applied for consistency.
* The installed base operating system is pre-configured with approved software repositories (like YUM or Debian). These software repositories allow for a consistent install, configuration, and upgrades for various common components like PHP or Java.
