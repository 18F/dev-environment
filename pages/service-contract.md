<a name="service-contract"></a>
There is a defined support contract specifying a base-line level of service and software support.
This should include but isn't limited to:

* System configuration is managed in a version control system and should be automatically applied for consistency.
* The base operating system has a defined set of installed packages and versions from defined sources. Using the system's standard tools and repositories ensures that anyone can easily configure a new system to match the standard baseline for a particular project and provides a well-tested path for orderly upgrades to every component.
