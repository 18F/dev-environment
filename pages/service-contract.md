<a name="service-contract"></a>
There is a defined support contract specifying a base-line level of service and software support.
This should include but isn't limited to:

* System configuration is managed in a version control system and should be automatically applied for consistency.
* Defining a base operating system and pre-approved software repositores (like YUM or DEB) for common components like PHP or Python
