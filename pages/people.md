title: People not Systems

<a name="people"></a>
Technology use should be from the perspective of the person, not the system(s). 
Put another way, this is giving developers what they need to do their job and selecting hardware and software to support this. 
By allowing developers to work the way they want, they are more productive and consistent, which leads to a better product.
If done well, these systems become largely invisible while still allowing personal customization by the developer that is applied across work devices.
