Best practices are difficult to practice without a good environment in which to practice them. 
Here we enumerate the elements of a productive development environment.

O'Reilly has also put together a great document detailing a lot of the ideas covered here. You can find it at [A Field Guide to the Distributed Development Stack](http://sites.oreilly.com/odewahn/dds-field-guide/ch01.html)
